Liu yuxuan Week 2 learning journal

Learning Activities & Resources
This week I used Joomla to create a brand new web page, and my theme is still Eason guitar studio.
In the process of learning and using Joomla, I encountered some troublesome problems. For example, if I want to download the complete Joomla component, I need to connect to MySQL on my personal computer. So I encountered some problems during the operation. Finally, I used the editor on the web page to edit my web page, but I still had problems in the process. For example, entering Joomla will give a template called CASSIOPEIA, but the pictures inside Many things cannot be edited. I tried many solutions but could not complete the modification. I checked a lot of information. Here is the link:

Estimated Hours
this week I use at least 10h in my work, including to search how to solve my problem and learn how to use Joomla.

Content Insights
Joomla used this week is a very powerful component.Joomla! is open source, meaning anyone can view, modify, and distribute its source code. This encourages a large developer community, driving the platform's development.Joomla! provides a rich set of extensions and templates, making it adaptable to various website needs. Many third-party developers create plugins, modules, and themes for Joomla!. And Joomla! has good scalability and can be extended with plugins, modules, and components to meet the specific needs of different types of websites.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Through this week's study, I have learned a new way of making websites. I think this is a very useful skill. After in-depth study, I will compare Joomla and WordPress. Both have their own advantages. part, so if these are used in my future work, I will choose appropriate means to solve different needs.
