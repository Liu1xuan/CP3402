Week 4 learning journal

Learning Activities & Resources
This weekâ€™s main work is install the WordPress in our device.
In the process of installing, I met some problem. For example, after I installed, I cannot log in, the website showed me that I cannot connect to database or invalid database name. I tried to solve this problem but failed. Then I copied the wrong tips and pasted to YouTube and followed the video. In the end I log in successfully and crate my WordPress.

Estimated Hours
Maybe 2 hours in this week because everything almostly finished on class. 

Content Insights
I think this week we must know how to install the wordpress on our device. If one day we get a new computer and still need use WordPress, we should download and install it again.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
WordPress is a very powerful tool for creating website, I think it will give me many helps in my futur work maybe. Not only that, but If one day I really own one guitar stuodio I can design the website by myself. 

NOTE: the screenshot of installing process In Prac04.docx, you can see it at left side, the file include in Pra04.
