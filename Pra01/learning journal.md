CP3402
week 1 reflection

1.Learning Activities & Resources

This week I decided that my startup theme would be my own guitar studio. After that, I made a preliminary design for my web page, including three pages: home, about, and contact. In fact, my expectation is to make five web pages, because there is also a classes section and a Buy section, in order to provide customers with more complete services.

In this process, I first reviewed the content of CP1406 from LearnJCU. Here I reviewed and learned some basic knowledge, such as the basic structure of html files and how to insert pictures. After that, I learned how to use CSS files to control my html files from these places. The following are the materials and links I have read (some of them are Chinese websites, because my English is not particularly good, and I can understand it better when reading Chinese. thorough).

Learn how to use CSS: https://www.runoob.com/html/html-css.html And I found this website I think it is very useful: https://www.w3school.com.cn/cssref/pr_background-size.asp

2.Estimated Hours 
In total, I probably spent at least seven hours on Practical this week. Among them, it took about four hours or more to modify my own web page, and about three hours or more to browse materials and study.

3.Content Insights The Guitar Studio Theme I thought was a great introduction to WordPress theme creation, I learned that WorldPress is built on PHP and MySQL and released under a GPLv2 license, which means anyone can use, modify and distribute it for free . In addition to this I also learned about PHP, which is an open source server scripting language widely used for server-side scripting programming. It was originally designed for web development but can also be used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP scripts are executed on the server to generate dynamic web content. In general, the prerequisite for using these tools well is to write html, javascrpt, etc., because these programming languages ​​and technologies will still be used. After studying these, I feel that my self-learning ability has improved somewhat and I also clearly understand how to do some projects.

4.Career/Employability/Learning Insights After completing the first week of practice, I started to check out some learning courses about guitar studios from websites such as Youtube bilibili. Before I looked at these, my expectation was that they could give me some good ideas and guide me. I did learn some things that I didn't think I would have learned otherwise, such as giving me some ideas for web pages, and I learned some more advanced CSS writing techniques that I think will be great for creating more details in my websites in the future. it works. From this strategy to this week's study, I came to the conclusion that this way of learning is useful, but I think there are many parts that may be a waste of time. For example, a video is 30 minutes long, and there may be parts that I can use. Only five minutes. So I think we should find solutions when we encounter problems, which will be more targeted and efficient.
